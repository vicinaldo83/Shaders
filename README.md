# SandLab

Git for testing and save our game. it still in work progress, do not have too much to do yet.
At the beginning was trying to use some C# based engine to build it, but some things happened and we thought was better to change it to Three.js

# Try by yourself
For try it in Node.js, obviously  you need to [install it first](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

So just execute this commands
``` bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
npm run build
```

In a near future, it will probably be ported to Electron or something like it.
